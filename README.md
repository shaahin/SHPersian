SHPersian
=========


`SHPersian` is a set of tools for Persian/Arabic iOS App developers.

This package includes required classes to add custom look and feel to texts in your Persian iOS apps.

This also includes custom controls with built-in custom Persian font support out of the box.


## How to Use

You may take a look at the sample project to get how to use the `SHPersian` controls. It's so simple.

### SHLabel

For apps that show Persian/Arabic texts in `UILabel`s, You may just change the class name for the `UILabel` to `SHLabel`. Then add a row with `Font` for title, and your custom font name as String value in the "User Defined Runtime Attributes" section in your storyboard. That's all. Your text will now render in your custom font look. `SHLabel` now supports multiline text handling.

You can access `-actualHeight` to get the size of the label for showing the whole text in lines. You can also use `-resizeToFitText` to let `SHLabel` resize itself and set it's height for text to fit.

### SHButton

And now you can use `SHButton` instead of `UIButton`s. change the class name for the `UIButton` to `SHButton`. You can add a row with `Font` for title, and your custom font name as String value in the "User Defined Runtime Attributes" section in your storyboard. It works like the standard `UIButton` but it supports Persian fonts and will render the button title correctly.
